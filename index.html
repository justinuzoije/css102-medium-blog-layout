    <h1>Introducing Apex Ping</h1>
    <p>
      I’d like to introduce Apex Ping! A minimalistic, but powerful uptime &
      performance monitoring service for websites and APIs. In this post I’ll
      cover features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it first, and a few
      things I learned in the process. In future posts I’ll be detailing the
      implementation for anyone who is curious. I soft-launched Ping about a
      month ago, built almost 100% on AWS Lambda, with 500 users it has already
      detected over a million errors, and performed over 25 million checks. Big
      thanks to the early adopters who have checked it out!

    <h1>The product</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve seen first-hand how embarrassing it can be when customers find out
      your product is having issues before you do, naturally this can translate
      to customers bailing on your product. Ensuring your site, app, or API is
      stable and performant is critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apex Ping helps by making sure your team is notified when there’s a
      performance regression, or when your end-point is down or unresponsive.
      Often people rely on “it works for me”, but Apex Ping’s reporting can help
      uncover the full story.

    <h2>Powerful monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike some other uptime monitoring services, which only support HEAD
      requests, Apex Ping support header fields and bodies as well. This allows
      you to test APIs, caching behaviour, and serving time, as well as the
      typical connection latency. The checks listing displays the uptime, mean
      response, Apdex score, and Adpex score throughout the day, week, or month.
      The Apdex score generalizes the user experience, summarizing response time
      satisfaction and error responses.

    <h2>Global Checks</h2>
    <p>
      Requests or “checks” are performed from a number of selectable PoPs
      (Point of Presence), giving you a glance at the customer experience all
      over the world. Hovering a PoP provides you with the breakdown, and
      coloring indicates their relative health so you can instantly see if a
      region’s availability or performance is degraded.

    <h2>Latency distribution</h2>
    <p>
      When latency is a reflection of the user-experience, it’s important not to
      ignore the outliers. The Latency view provides you with an intuitive look
      at distribution throughout the selected time period, where the intensity
      of the heatmap represents the number of check’s within the given duration.

    <h2>Errors & Apex</h2>
    <p>
      The Apdex (Application Performance Index) score quantifies the
      user-experience based on a configured target latency. It effectively lets
      you know how far you are from hitting your mark, you should strive for a
      perfect 1.0!
